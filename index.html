   <p>Tintin is shown as a well-rounded yet open-ended character, noting that his rather neutral personality, odd given the evil, folly and foolhardiness which he encounters. His boy-scout-style ideals, which represent Hergé's own, have never been compromised by the character either. Tintin has a tendency to tie and gag people, is often shown enjoying doing this. Unlike other characters such as Captain Haddock or Professor Calculus, Tintin has no discernible backstory. Unlike Haddock and Calculus, Tintin's roots prior to Tintin in the Land of the Soviets are never discussed. His companions encounter old friends such as Captain Chester or Hercules Tarragon, yet Tintin only meets friends or enemies whom he met in previous adventures. At the end of Tintin and Alph-Art he is to be turned into a Cesar. Although is seems very unlikely that he dies, his fate is still left unknown. -HERGE</p>

At the end of Tintin and Alph-Art he is to be turned into a Cesar. Although is seems very unlikely that he dies, his fate is still left unknown. 


    <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
    <p>Although Tintin's physique has had various changes overtime, there are a three predominant factors of him that have always remained ever since his debut. Tintin has been depicted as a young male with short ginger hair accompanied by a signature quiff and has black dot eyes like many other characters. In the earlier titles and older editions of the books, he had a very literal ball-shaped head, a long nose, no eyebrows most of the time, and was shorter than most other characters. However, as the series progressed, Tintin's head became less like that of a literal sphere, had his nose shortened, became taller and generally had more realistic human proportions. </p>

    <p>Tintin has worn many different clothes throughout the installments, but his most iconic outfit consists of a white collared shirt underneath a blue crewneck jumper, a pair of brown plus-fours (later causal trousers), white or black socks, and brown loafers that are fastened by either laces or buckles. He also frequently wears either a beige trench coat over this outfit or a brown blazer.</p>

    <p>In 2011 motion-capture film, Tintin had pale complexion and his eyes are turquoise green. In the mystery of the Unicorn found at the globe in Marlinspike Hall, he wore white shirt, black necktie, sunshine yellow V shaped necked sweater vest, brown jacket and plus fours, black socks and dark brown shoes. </p>

    <h3>International names for Tintin </h3>

        <li>Afrikaans: Kuifie</li>
        <li>Arabic: تان تان (Tàn Tàn)</li>
        <li>Chinese: 丁丁 (Dīngdīng)</li>
        <li>Dutch: Kuifje</li>
        <li>Finnish: Tintti</li>
        <li>German: Tim</li>
        <li>Greek: Τεντέν</li>
        <li>Portuguese: Tintim</li>
        <li>Russian: Тинтин (Tintin)</li>

        <li>Thai: ตินติน (Tintin)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Personality</h3>

    <p>Tintin's personality evolved as Hergé wrote the series. Peeters related that in the early Adventures, Tintin's personality was "incoherent", in that he was "[s]ometimes foolish and sometimes omniscient, pious to the point of mockery and then unacceptably aggressive", ultimately just serving as a "narrative vehicle" for Hergé's plots. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline noted that in the early Adventures, Tintin showed "little sympathy for humanity". Assouline described the character as "obviously celibate, excessively virtuous, chivalrous, brave, a defender of the weak and oppressed, never looks for trouble but always finds it; he is resourceful, takes chances, is discreet, and is a nonsmoker." </p>

    <p>Michael Farr deemed Tintin to be an intrepid young man of high moral standing, with whom his audience can identify. His rather neutral personality permits a balanced reflection of the evil, folly, and foolhardiness that surrounds him, allowing the reader to assume Tintin's position within the story rather than merely following the adventures of a strong protagonist. Tintin's iconic representation enhances this aspect, with comics expert Scott McCloud noting that the combination of Tintin's iconic, neutral personality and Hergé's "unusually realistic", signature ligne claire ("clear line") style "allows the reader to mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world." </p>

    <p>To the other characters, Tintin is honest, decent, compassionate, and kind. He is also modest and self-effacing, which Hergé also was, and is the most loyal of friends, which Hergé strove to be. The reporter does have vices, becoming too tipsy before facing the firing squad (in The Broken Ear) or too angry when informing Captain Haddock that he nearly cost them their lives (in Explorers on the Moon). However, as Michael Farr observed, Tintin has "tremendous spirit" and, in Tintin in Tibet, was appropriately given the name Great Heart. By turns, Tintin is innocent, politically crusading, escapist, and finally cynical. If he had perhaps too much of the goody-goody about him, at least he was not priggish; Hergé admitting as much, saying, "If Tintin is a moralist, he's a moralist who doesn't take things too seriously, so humour is never far away from his stories." It is this sense of humour that makes the appeal of Tintin truly international. </p>

    <h3>Characters</h3>
<p>Just as Alfred Hitchcock made furtive appearances in his films, Hergé couldn’t resist joining in the adventures of his characters. He discreetly drew himself into the scenery, appearing as a reporter dutifully taking notes when Tintin embarks for the Congo, or interviewing a local in front of the gates to Marlinspike Hall, in hope of gaining the latest on the story of the broken glass in The Calculus Affair. In Hergé’s universe, it’s hard to find a character that has been created from scratch: most were inspired by real people who were either close to the author in some way, historical figures or celebrities at the time.</p>
